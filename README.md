# NetworkOptimisationAssistant (NOA)

## Description
Network Optimisation Assistant (NOA) is a proof-of-concept design of a voice assistant that can monitor and optimise bandwidth usage in home networks. The user will be able to talk to the assistant, in order to gain a deeper understanding of their home network and perform technical funcitons without needing to understand how or why it works.

The main requirements that this assistant provides includes:
* Bandwidth Monitoring
* Network Path Optimisation
* Guest Network Management
* Access Control Levels
* Educational Capabilities

This is part of my Final Year Project/Dissertation at Lancaster University.
